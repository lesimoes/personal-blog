A couple of years ago I abandoned social networks, sticking only with Linkedin. At that time I didn't see any reason to scroll and waste time on social networks. Nothing there capture my attention. Except for business purposes, I don't think there is any reason to stay on social networks. They don't provide add good information and don't offer valuable learning experiences. As a former teacher, I can tell you can't learn much from 30-second video.

Two years later, I realize there is a bigger problem on social networks, especially those controlled by big techs. It seems like the internet has turned into just social networks. Our ideas, photos, videos, text are controlled by fewer big techs. They use our data to show us more ads and train their models while feeding us an endless content.

This is the opposite of what web 1.0 was and how I believe the internet should be. The internet should be a free space where everyone has a space to share their knowledge, thoughts, or anything else. A place to study, learn, share, have fun, in deliberate way

Seeing another person's point of view could be amazing, with no ads, no recommendations, no attention hooks. But we lost that on the way.

However, there is an alternative: a decentralized web with services that no bigtech can not control or monetize, called the Fediverse. It promises to bring us back to a free web, a place where we are not products, bus just people.
